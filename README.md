ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bharath, a Software Development Engineer (SDE) at Amazon, passionate about building scalable and innovative software solutions. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

ðŸŒ± I'm currently diving deep into distributed systems and cloud technologies, exploring ways to optimize performance and enhance user experience.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to discussing opportunities for collaboration or projects related to software development, particularly in the areas of backend systems, scalability, and performance optimization.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me on email (bharath.workmail12@gmail.com) for professional inquiries or just to connect and chat about all things tech!

âš¡ Fun fact: Outside of coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
